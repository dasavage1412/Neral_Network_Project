# Neral_Network_Project
## Overview
The goal of this project was to use different variations of neral networks to predit the success of applicants funded by Alphebet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The variable that we were targetting was the Is_Successful variable as it is the one that we were attempting to predict
- All columns were features with the exceptions of the EIN and Name variables
- The above mentions columns were not included and could be removed
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- I used the guide line of 8 nodes in layer one and 5 in layer 2 
- I was not able to achieve the target of 75% model preformance
- I used less nodes per layer and less epocs, Then I tried inceasing by amount double that new number. None of these led to a substancial increase in my models performance.

## Summary
The overall results were not very compeling. I think that there may have been a difference in the data set. There may not be a subastancial impact of Alphebet soups service on the success of people who pay for the service.
